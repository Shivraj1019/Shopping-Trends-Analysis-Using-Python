# Shopping-Trends-Analysis-Using-Python
For a project on identifying shopping trends analysis using Python, you can focus on analyzing customer purchase behavior, seasonal buying patterns, and product preferences. The project could involve using historical sales data to identify trends over time and predicting future buying patterns. Tools like pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization, and machine learning algorithms such as clustering or regression could be used to segment customers and forecast trends. The project can also include sentiment analysis on customer reviews to understand product popularity.
